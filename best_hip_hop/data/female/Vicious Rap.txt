I said the T-U-R the K-E-Y
I said the man isn't bad, you can't deny
He got the sticks in his hand and foot on the drums
And all the females, they're tryna get a little some
Of KD y'all, he's gonna rock the place
And he has the bass up in my face
He got the rhythm in his fingers without a doubt
He make the dudes stand back, the females start to shout
And there's the Marty Mar on the guitar
I said the man isn't bad, he is a star
He got a whole lotta rhythm and a lotta soul
He put the guys in check, the females in control
Then there's little ol' me as you can see
And I go by the name of uh Sweet Tee
So sit back, relax and just take a chill
'Cause Sweet Tee - hah - she's gonna tell you the deal
So get a touch, huh, I'm too much, huh
I throw the best throwdown in the nation
No other MC in creation
Like me, could be faster
Just to rock this world
'Cause I'm hard as a rock and present as a [?]
It's only me, that's all you need
I got the policy of satisfaction guaranteed
So just open up your eyes so you can see
Just why they call me MC Sweet Tee
Yes, I throw down hard and I rock so well
I'll put you under a magic spell
I'm representin' and I'm nice [?] my clientele
'Cause on a scale of 1 to 10, I was [?] 12
So get a touch huh, I'm too much huh
And ya don't stop, ya keep on y'all
I said before the Lord God made the sea and the land
He gave Sweet Tee the master plan
And the message to give all the other MCs
About the earth, sea and sky the birds and the bees
How to make money, take money, steal, cheat and lie
The main definition of the word survive
I know you heard the philosophy about
You got to give a little to gain a lot
But these words don't pull [?]
Take a good look, look at the government
How they sit back, relax and don't give a damn
And everytime you turn around, they're holdin' out your hand
And when you think of it, I said you start to holla
'Bout the eight cents tax that's on the dollar
So we all get mad and it's hot as a fire
But soon ya cool off and prices get higher
And before you know it you can't buy many
With a dollar because the value is a penny
For the money, huh, we're gonna scream and shout
And let the government know what we all about
So get a touch huh, I'm too much huh
And ya don't stop, ya keep on
Say I was rockin' a party just a-doing my best
When a man told me I was under arrest
He said "Follow me ma'am if you will
And when we get downtown I'll tell you the deal"
So he bagged a vice and then he cuffed my hands
He drove me downtown to the big man
For a year or two they looked around and about
Wanted to know what Sweet Tee was all about
I said I don't know what or why I'm here
But without a doubt I have no fear
He said "Get in the cell and don't waste my time
Because you're under arrest for first degree rhymes
The next day, huh, ya see I went to court
And I took the stand just like I was taught
They put the Bible in my hand that says speak the truth
And when they took it away, I said "I do"
I said I'm just an MC, that's all I am
And I shock the house when there's a mic in my hand
I don't snort, I don't smoke, I just keep it clean
And I am not into the junkie scene
I'm just asking for a little sympathy
Because my crew, ha, is wating for me
So they took the votes and they let me go
And here I am, I said, in stereo
In stereo, ha, and ya don't stop
Now there's a couple of girls that's alright with me
They ain't DJs and they ain't MCs
They put the dudes in check and it ain't a joke
That's Jackie J and Big [?]
When we walkin' down the street side by side
The males take a chill and the girls stand aside
We're not gangsters or the mafia
We won't mess with you if you won't mess with us
And get a touch huh, I'm too much huh
And ya don't stop, ya keep on
Like a 1, like a 2, like a boogaloo flu
Like a nickle bag of [?]
Like some some [?] jeans, like a disco scene
Like me in my Cadillac
Like a chair has a leg, like a ladder has a peg
Like a doggie has a growl
Like a night to a day, [?] all day
And I never seem to understand how, huh
Check it huh and ya don't stop
Ya keep on til you hit the top
The break of dawn y'all, break of dawn y'all
This is out y'all, sure shit y'all
Check it out y'all, and ya don't stop
And ya don't stop, you let it roll
[?] let it roll, you let it roll
Marty Mar you just let it roll, you let it roll
KD you just let it roll and you don't stop
Ad you don't stop, and you don't stop

One more time y'all
I said the T-U-R the K-E-Y
I said the man isn't bad, you can't deny
He got the sticks in his hand and foot on the drums
And all the females, they're tryin' to get a little some
Of KD y'all, he's gonna rock the place
And he has the bass up in my face
He got the rhythm in his fingers without a doubt
He make the dudes stand back, the females start to shout
And there's the Marty Mar on the guitar
I said the man isn't bad, he is a star
He got a whole lotta rhythm and a lotta soul
He put the guys in check, the females in control
Then there's little ol' me as you can see
And I go by the name of uh Sweet Tee
So sit back, relax and just take a chill
'Cause Sweet Tee - hah - I'm gonna tell you the deal

A one time huh, for the mind y'all
Beat beat y'all, for the beat y'all
Keep it on y'all, and ya don't stop
And ya don't and ya don't stop

So get a touch huh, I'm too much huh
And ya don't stop, ya keep on
And this is Tee
[?] on the go
And I'm here to rock your stere-ere-ereo
So grab a chair and park that rear
I got a couple of rhymes I want you to hear
And I gotta story I want to tell
To all the fly guys and all the fly girls
So listen good and listen well
'Cause I am not known for repeating myself
One time y'all, for the mind y'all
And beat beat bop and ya don't stop
Keep it on y'all, ya keep it on y'all
Keep it on to the break of dawn
Break of dawn huh, break of dawn huh
This is it y'all, sure shit y'all
So check me out huh, and ya don't stop
And ya don't stop, you let it roll
Everybody you just let it roll
Let it roll, everybody
Ya just let it roll, let it roll
Sweet Tee, just let it roll, let it roll
KD you just let it roll, let it roll
Marty Mar you just let it roll, let it roll
[?] just let it roll and ya don't stop
