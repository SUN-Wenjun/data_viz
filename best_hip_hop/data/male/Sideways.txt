You know it ain't easy
For these thoughts here to leave me
No words to describe it
In French or in English
'Cause diamonds, they fade
And flowers, they bloom
And I'm tellin' you
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
They've been knockin' me out lately
Whenever you come around me
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinkin' in a moment that
Time will take them away
These feelings won't go away
These feelings won't go away
It ain't easy
For these thoughts here to leave me
There are no words to describe it
In French or in English
'Cause diamonds, they fade
And flowers, they bloom
And I'm tellin' you
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
They've been knockin' me out lately
Whenever you come around me
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinkin' that in a moment that
Time will take them away
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinkin' that in a moment that
Time will take them away
These feelings won't go away
These feelings won't go away
Diamonds, they fade
And flowers, they bloom
And I'm tellin' you
And I'm tellin' you
Diamonds, they fade
And flowers, they bloom
And I'm tellin' you
And I'm tellin' you
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
They've been knockin' me out lately
Whenever you come around me
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinkin' that in a moment that
Time will take them away
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
