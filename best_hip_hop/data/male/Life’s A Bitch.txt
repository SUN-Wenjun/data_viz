20, it's a blessing
Essence of adolescence leaves my body, fresh and
physical frame celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull 'cause it's pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, I used to do my thing hard
Robbing foreigners, take their wallets, they jewelery
Rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash
Got my first piece of ass smoking blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto, instead of saying "fuck tomorrow"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
At times I look back, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic that crack your whole cabbage
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff la
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
Why we get high
Never know, that's real shit right
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff la
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
